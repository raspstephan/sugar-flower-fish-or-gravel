# Raw Zooniverse data

This directory contains the raw Zooniverse output files. `classifications` files contain the human labels. `subject` files contain information about the individual images.

For instruction on how to read and clean this data, check out `organize-raw-dataset.ipynb` in the `notebooks` directory.

There are also files that have already been preprocessed in `preprocessed_data`.
